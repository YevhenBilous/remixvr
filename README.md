## RemixVR

RemixVR is a tool to collaboratively build editable VR experiences.

The editable VR experiences are called VR templates. Anyone can create a VR template. Each VR template will have configurable options that can be selected by the user. These options allow the user to create custom VR experiences from a single VR template.

For example, let's look at the [ObjectsVR](https://github.com/teliportme/remixvr/tree/master/themes/packages/objectsvr) template. It has three options. You can change the object, the 360 background and the sound it creates when hovering on the object.

In the initial version, these options are updated by editing the code. However, as we continue to develop RemixVR, we'll be including a visual way to update the options.

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Documentation

You can read [RemixVR docs](https://docs.remixvr.org/) to view all the documentation about the project.

### Demos

* [Atomic Bohr Model](https://bohrmodel-remixvr.netlify.com/)
* [360 VR](https://360vr-remixvr.netlify.com/)
* [Particles VR](https://particlevr-remixvr.netlify.com/)
* [Objects VR](https://objectsvr-remixvr.netlify.com/)

### Installing RemixVR

To install and setup RemixVR, please see the [installation guide](docs/installation.md#steps-to-setup-remixvr-on-your-computer).

#### Running a VR template

Once you have installed all the dependencies, to start a VR template, go to the template folder and in the terminal run `yarn start`.

For example, to start the ObjectsVR template, go to the template folder.

```bash
cd packages/objectsvr
```

Once you're inside the template folder, then start the development server.

```bash
yarn start
```

You can view the template by going to `http://localhost:8080/` on your browser.

### Running the tests

To run the test, navigate to the root folder of remixVR. Then run:

```bash
yarn run test
```

The test files are present inside the template folder. The test files ends with _.test.js_ in their file name. You can look at [ObjectsVR test](https://github.com/teliportme/remixVR/tree/3bfcac83b55bf003900a1b90e61a49466b3a5bf4/templates/packages/objectsvr/objectsvr.test.js) file to see an example.
